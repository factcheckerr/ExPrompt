    "As of 2017, Ross owned several different Wingstop restaurant locations. Wingstop is a fast-food chain specializing in chicken wings. When Don Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023, Ross offered him a job, saying, \"For some reason, I believe you know what you doing with the lemon pepper wings. So man, just send over your résumé.\" Legal issues\n",
    "In January 2008, Ross was arrested on gun and marijuana charges. During a deposition of Officer Rey Hernandez, a Miami Beach police officer who arrested Ross, Ross's lawyer, Allan Zamren, asked Hernandez why Ross's case was assigned to the gang task force. The officer stated that it was because Ross claimed affiliation with Triple C's (aka Carol City Cartel), and other known gang members. Zamren pressed Hernandez for a personal link between Ross and the gang members, but the officer did not provide proof.In August 2008, YouTube entertainer DJ Vlad filed a lawsuit against Ross for assault and battery. Vlad claimed Ross organized an ambush on him at the 2008 Ozone Awards in Houston, Texas for asking questions about his past as a correctional officer.In June 2010 \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross sued Ross for using his name, filing a copyright infringement lawsuit in a California federal court. Jay-Z had been called to testify in the lawsuit, as he was CEO of Def Jam when Ross/Roberts was signed. \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross, a reformed drug kingpin, sought $10 million in damages in his lawsuit. Also, Freeway Ricky Ross threatened to block the release of Ross's album, Teflon Don. A week after the lawsuit was filed, Rick Ross responded to the charges: \"It's like owning a restaurant, you're gonna have a few slip and falls. You get lawsuits, you deal with them, and get them out your way ... sometimes you lose.\" He denied rumors that he would change his name to \"Ricky Rozay\" as a consequence of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was thrown out of court on July 3, 2010. The album Teflon Don was released as scheduled on July 20, 2010. A federal judge ruled that the case should be refiled in California state court because it fell under California state law. \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross refiled the case with the State of California and the federal case is on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The state case was filed in 2011 in California. \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross refiled in Los Angeles Superior Court with publicity rights claims. Trial was set for early May 2012. The case was dismissed by a judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court.The California State case was updated with a motion in Freeway Rick Ross's favor as to Warner Bros. Records and their use of the name and image Rick Ross in July 2012.On December 30, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the rapper Rick Ross, allowing him to keep the name based on a First Amendment ruling.In 2011, the rapper Teflon Don filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Ross for the use of the name as an album title.On March 26, 2011, Ross was arrested in Shreveport for possession of marijuana. According to the police records, a strong odor of marijuana was detected from his room at the Hilton in Downtown Shreveport. Ross was arrested on June 27, 2014, in Greensboro, N.C., following his performance at the 2014 SuperJam at the Greensboro Coliseum. The arrest stemmed from a year-old warrant for another North Carolina arrest related to marijuana possession; Ross reportedly failed to appear in court for that violation in 2013.On June 24, 2015, Rick Ross and his bodyguard were arrested in Fayette County, Georgia on kidnapping and assault charges. Both were accused for forcing a landskeeper into a guesthouse and beating him in the head with a handgun, allegedly over money he owed Ross. On April 4, 2017, Ross pled no contest to a felony count of aggravated assault. The other felony charges were dropped. Ross was sentenced to time served in jail, having already been incarcerated for a week and was also ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. Ross was sentenced as a first-time felony offender; and, upon payment of the fine, the conviction was erased from his record. Ross pled no contest to 5 misdemeanours: assault, battery, two counts of pointing a pistol at someone, and possession of less than 1 oz of cannabis. For the five misdemeanours, he was given a total of 60 months probation. Controversies\n",
    "Feud with 50 Cent\n",
    "In January 2009, Ross started a feud with rapper 50 Cent because he supposedly looked at him the wrong way at the BET Hip Hop Awards in 2008. 50 Cent told news sources that he did not remember seeing Ross there. In late January, \"Mafia Music\", by Ross, leaked onto the Internet. There were several lines that seemed to diss 50 Cent. Days later, 50 Cent released \"Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)\" in response to Ross's disparaging remarks on his \"Mafia Music\" song. Before going to Venezuela, 50 Cent uploaded a video entitled \"Warning Shot\", wherein he stated: \"Rick Ross, I'mma fuck your life up for fun.\" In addition, 50 Cent released the first of a series of \"Officer Ricky\" cartoons. Early in February, 50 Cent once again made a video which he uploaded to YouTube in which he interviewed \"Tia\", the mother of one of Ross's children. She verifies that he was a correctional officer and claims his whole persona is fake and fraudulent. On February 5, 2009, The Game, who 50 Cent has a long-standing \"beef\" with, called up Seattle R&B station KUBE. When asked about the beef between 50 Cent and Ross, Game sided with 50 Cent and said that things are not looking good for Ross. He offered to help, stating, \"Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man,\" and, \"50 eating you, boy. \"On his album Deeper Than Rap, Ross references 50 Cent in the song \"In Cold Blood\". A video for the song was released that portrayed 50 Cent's mock funeral. Upon release, Ross stated that he has ended 50 Cent's career. That same day Ross released a new diss track called \"Push 'Em Over The Edge\". The next day 50 Cent released the controversial video \"A Psychic Told Me\", dissing DJ Khaled. On February 12, 50 Cent responded with \"Tia Told Me\", along with Lloyd Banks' response \"Officer Down\" and Tony Yayo's \"Somebody Snitched\". In an interview, 50 Cent said Ross is \"Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He's Albert,\" he added. \"It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer's perspective. \"On January 30, 2013, 50 Cent claimed via Twitter that the drive-by shooting that Ross experienced on his birthday two days ago was \"staged\", reigniting the feud.A year later, on March 28, 2014, Rick Ross was asked about his feud with 50 Cent. He stated that he does not wish to speak on him anymore, and that he is done with the feud.His feud with 50 Cent has been resurfacing. The reason of the second reignition would be because of Ross's MMG record-label artist Meek Mill, who defended his mentor and criticised 50 on his 4/4 EP. Lyric controversy\n",
    "In a line on rapper Rocko's 2013 song \"U.O.E.N.O. \", Rick Ross raps the line, \"Put molly all in her champagne / She ain't even know it / I took her home and I enjoyed that / She ain't even know it.\" A petition containing 72,000 signatures was presented to Reebok, demanding they drop Ross as a spokesman for the lyrics which appeared to condone date rape. Ross has apologized for the lyrics, claiming they weren't about rape.On April 11, 2013, one month after the song's release, Ross was dropped by Reebok. Reebok stated, \"while we do not believe that Rick Ross condones sexual assault, we are very disappointed he has yet to display an understanding of the seriousness of this issue or an appropriate level of remorse.\" They continued on to say, \"at this time, it is in everyone's best interest for Reebok to end its partnership with Mr. Ross. \"Though Ross apologized for the lyrics, he also argued that his lyrics were misinterpreted because he did not directly use the word \"rape.\" He says, \"You know I would never use the term rape in my records ... in reality some people do these things, and shouldn't it be brought to light so young women can protect themselves?!\" He continued on Twitter, \"I would never use the term 'rape' in my records and as far as my camp. Hip-Hop don't condone that, the streets don't condone that, nobody condones that. \"A 2013 Ross concert organized by the student association of Carleton University was cancelled after protests that his lyrics promote rape culture. Rocko later dropped the Rick Ross verse in order to get radio play. Discography\n",
