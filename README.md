# ExPrompt
Detecting the veracity of a statement automatically is a challenge the world is grappling with due to the vast amount of data spread across the web. Verifying a given claim typically entails validating it within the framework of supporting evidence like a retrieved piece of text. Classifying the stance of the text with respect to the claim is called stance classification and is an important part of many approaches that tackle the automatic identification of false information and fake news. Despite advancements in automated fact-checking, most systems still rely on a substantial quantity of labeled training data, which can be costly. In this work, we avoid the costly training or fine-tuning of models by reusing pre-trained large language models together with few-shot in-context learning. Since we do not train any model, our approach ExPrompt is lightweight,
demands fewer resources than other stance classification methods and can server as a modern baseline for future developments. At the same time, our evaluation shows that our approach is able to outperform former state-of-the-art stance classification approaches regarding accuracy by at least 2 percent.
